# Programming Assignment 3

This Assignment consist of the following three questions:

1. Find the last element of list with its index value(dont use inbuilt methods to extract last element directly)
2. Print the table of each element in the List
3. Implement Stack and Queue using Lists.

I have created four classes namely LastElementWithIndex, TableOfEachElement, StackUsingList, QueueUsingList to implenent the functionality of above three questions.
